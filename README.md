#GPU based Jaro Winkler string distance

This project will eventually contain the source code for GPU accelerated String Distance Matrix calculations.

Included so far in this project is a non-parallel version of the distance metric.
This is a proof of concept and speed test so isn't designed to be useable.
Currently returns the distance matrix for a string vector and itself.

Also included is an R script to measure as a baseline in terms of speed using the stringdist package.

Also included is a script to generate random strings for testing purposes.
